Project/Goals
The primary question is to explore the evolution of movies over decades, uncovering trends in movie production, success, and crucial findings in genres.

Process

1. Initiated by understanding our data and defining the problem.
2. Performe data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.
and Visualizations
3. Performed vizualization on tabluea to answe to find trends and answer our question.
4. Make a regression model on python

Results

Explored the relationship between average runtime and the years, coupled with a gross percentage. Noted a positive trend, observing a slight decrease in gross for lower average runtimes. The percentage difference in gross exhibited a 14 percent decrease, gradually increasing by 2019.
Investigated movie ratings by decade, highlighting shifts in audience preferences. Observed a decrease in 'PG' ratings, an increase in 'PG-13,' and a sustained presence of 'R' ratings, indicating evolving tastes.
Conducted a genre-wise exploration by decade, revealing trends such as the rise of action, a decline in comedy, and the gradual prominence of genres like biography and animation.
Compared the periods 1980-2010 and 2011-2019, marked by the introduction of streaming platforms. Focused on the top 10 companies' gross and budget, introducing new companies like Marvel Studios. Explored the influence of technological advancements in computer graphics, reflecting in the surge of action and adventure genres.

Observations
Action genre consistently claims the highest percentage of total gross in each decade, with a notable increase over the years, particularly in the last decade.
Animation genre experiences a steady 5% increase in each decade, transitioning from being one of the least profitable in the 80s to the second-highest, constituting nearly 20% of total gross in the last decade.
Possible explanations for these changes include Disney's substantial budget increase and advancements in animation technology.

Correlations
Decent correlations primarily emerge between budget and gross, as well as gross and votes. Higher budgets often translate to enhanced production quality, including renowned stars and advanced technologies like CGI, contributing to a movie's financial success and popularity.


Challenges
Coming up with questions, although the data is good it was hard in the beginning to come with analysis ideas and try to get the ball rolling.

Future Goals
Combine more datasets with ours in order to do more analysis and try to find more trends and correlations.
